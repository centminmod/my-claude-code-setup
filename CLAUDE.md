## About Me

Vibe coder learning Swift and web development on macOS. No formal developer experience.

## How to Help Me

- **Explain simply** - I'm not a developer, avoid jargon or explain it
- **Show the "why"** - Don't just give code, help me understand it
- **Keep it simple** - Prefer readable code over clever code
- **Test your work** - Use the verify-app agent before saying you're done
- **One thing at a time** - Don't overwhelm me with options
